# ML-Project
 This project is related to Fake News Analysis using Machine Learning Techniques and Tools.
 
 # Project workflow:
 * Collecting Datasets on Fake News Analysis.
 * Building of a dataset from a set of known and well-done datasets.
 * Loading and Analyzing dataset.
 * Splitting the Dataset into training and testing sets.
 * Preprocessing of the text.
 * Choose a Learning Model, Methodology or Schema for training the dataset.
 * Fitting the Model with proper parameters and Predicting a feasible outcome. Check the Model Accuracy
 * Report and Visualization of the predicted outcomes.
 * If the results are not that convincing, then Tuning and Optimizing Model with necessary algorithms, is needed.
 * Testing the Optimized Model and Reporting its whereabouts and results.
 * After Prev.Step, if the obtained results are not still that convincing then "Repeat Prev->Prev.Step" with a more efficient technique.
 * Summary Report on the Model.
